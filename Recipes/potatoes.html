        <p>This Hasselback potatoes recipe makes seasoned potatoes crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. 
           This Swedish dish takes its name from Hasselbacken, the Stockholm restaurant where it was first served.</p>
        <p>Recipe by POMPIER850.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) baking potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely grated fresh Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned dry bread crumbsr</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Peel potatoes and place in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning.</li>
            <li>One at a time, dry potatoes and place in a large wooden or metal serving spoon. 
                Using a sharp knife, slice potato crosswise at 1/8-inch intervals, cutting until the knife touches the spoon, 
                being careful not to cut all the way through so the potato stays intact.</li>
            <li>Arrange potatoes cut-side up in a shallow baking dish or small roasting pan. Drizzle with 1/2 of the melted butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes; drizzle with remaining butter and sprinkle Romano cheese and bread crumbs on top. 
                Season with a little more salt and pepper and bake until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.</li>   
        </ol>
